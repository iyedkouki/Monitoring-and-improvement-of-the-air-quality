# Monitoring-and-improvement-of-the-air-quality
Development and implementation of an IoT -based system designed to monitor environmental conditions in real-time. Utilizing an STM32L4  microcontroller to interface with various sensors, the system collects data, which is then transmitted  to a cloud platform via an ESP32 module and Mobile application, developed using Android Studio.

Data Flow Overview:
This diagram represents the overall data flow in the air quality monitoring system, from the 
sensor readings to user interaction via the mobile application. The system integrates multiple 
components like sensors, microcontroller units (MCU), cloud storage, and the mobile app, 
each with specific roles.
